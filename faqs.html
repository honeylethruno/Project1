                          <p>Tarot cards are small, paper cards that come in a deck, similar to playing cards, and are used for divinatory purposes. Each card represents a different archetypal being or lesson. A person shuffles the cards, then lays them out in a Tarot card spread. Understanding what each Tarot card means when it is revealed can help a person receive an important message or embrace a new perspective in any situation.</p>

                          <h3 class="text-decoration-underline text-warning p-3">How do you read Tarot cards?</h3>
                            <p>There are four basic steps when you’re reading Tarot cards: First, consider your question, then select a Tarot spread with positions that relate to that question. Next, you'll shuffle the cards and lay them out in that spread, and finally, interpret the cards to answer your question. Anyone can learn how to read Tarot cards. There are many spreads available online to inspire you, and you don’t have to have the meaning of every card memorized -- you can look up the meanings by clicking on the cards above! Still, the traditional meaning of the Tarot cards is only part of it -- it's your own emotions and intuition that will help you understand how the cards that are revealed apply to your unique situation.

                            <p>Shuffling the Tarot cards before a reading is essential. It allows you to focus on why you’re doing the reading and to imprint your energy on the cards. Before shuffling, take a moment to relax and tune in to your intuition. Then, mix up the cards in any way that feels right -- cut or fan the deck over and over, or simply jumble the cards on the table and put them back together. There is no wrong way to shuffle your Tarot cards. No matter how you shuffle, it’s the intention that really matters. As you shuffle, be present and truly focus on the question for which you need answers.</p>

                            <p>Certainly not. Tarot cards rely on your intuition to shuffle and select the cards and to understand how they apply to you -- there is no evil force guiding them. If you’re wondering “Are Tarot cards safe?” then the answer is yes, absolutely. They are not meant to bring forth spirits or bad luck, they are intended to inspire awareness and help you discover healthy and successful ways to approach any part of your life.</p>
