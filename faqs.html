                            <p>The 22 Major Arcana cards represent life's karmic and spiritual lessons. They represent
                                a path to spiritual self-awareness and depict the various stages we encounter as we search for greater
                                meaning and understanding. In this way, the Major Arcana cards hold deeply meaningful lessons on a soul
                                level.</p>
                            <p>The 56 Minor Arcana cards reflect the trials and tribulations that we experience on a
                                daily basis. These Tarot cards highlight the more practical aspects of life and can refer to current issues
                                that have a temporary or minor influence.</p>
                            <p>Within the Minor Arcana cards, there are 16 Tarot Court Cards each representing 16
                                different personality characteristics we may choose to express at any given time. There are also the 40
                                numbered cards organised into 4 Suits - Cups, Pentacles, Swords and Wands - each with 10 cards, representing
                                various situations that we encounter day-to-day.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-decoration-underline text-warning p-3">How do you read Tarot cards?</h3>
                        <p>There are four basic steps when you're reading Tarot cards: First, consider your question, then select a
                            Tarot spread with positions that relate to that question. Next, you'll shuffle the cards and lay them out in
                            that spread, and finally, interpret the cards to answer your question. Anyone can learn how to read Tarot
                            cards. There are many spreads available online to inspire you, and you don't have to have the meaning of
                            every card memorized -- you can look up the meanings by clicking on the cards above! Still, the traditional
                            meaning of the Tarot cards is only part of it -- it's your own emotions and intuition that will help you
                            understand how the cards that are revealed apply to your unique situation.

                        <h3 class="text-decoration-underline text-warning p-3">How do you shuffle Tarot cards?</h3>
                        <p>Shuffling the Tarot cards before a reading is essential. It allows you to focus on why you're doing the
                            reading and to imprint your energy on the cards. Before shuffling, take a moment to relax and tune in to
                            your intuition. Then, mix up the cards in any way that feels right -- cut or fan the deck over and over, or
                            simply jumble the cards on the table and put them back together. There is no wrong way to shuffle your Tarot
                            cards. No matter how you shuffle, it's the intention that really matters. As you shuffle, be present and
                            truly focus on the question for which you need answers.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-decoration-underline text-warning p-3">Are Tarot cards evil?</h3>
                        <p>Certainly not. Tarot cards rely on your intuition to shuffle and select the cards and to understand how they
                            apply to you -- there is no evil force guiding them. If you're wondering “Are Tarot cards safe?” then the
                            answer is yes, absolutely. They are not meant to bring forth spirits or bad luck, they are intended to
                            inspire awareness and help you discover healthy and successful ways to approach any part of your life.</p>
